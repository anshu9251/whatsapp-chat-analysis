Ich bin 22 Jahre alt und begeisterte Person aus Indien. Ich bin eine ordentliche aufrichtige Person, die Sauberkeit mag (zumindest in den gemeinsamen Bereichen von Küche und Flur). Ich habe Erfahrung mit dem Leben in einem Wohnheim während des Studiums in Indien. Um Ihnen mehr über mich zu erzählen, freue ich mich auf die Wochenenden, wenn ich mit meinen Freunden entspannen und die Ruhe des Lebens in einer Wohnung genießen kann. Ich lebe, ich liebe, ich verbreite Freude und ich gebe nie auf, weil ich glaube, dass das Leben schön ist und es immer Hoffnung gibt. Die Wohnung hat mir sehr gut gefallen und ich würde gerne am 1. Oktober einziehen, weil meine Vorlesung am 1. Oktober 2023 beginnt. Ich suche für mindestens sechs Monate und bis zu einem Jahr. Ich wünsche Ihnen einen schönen Tag und freue mich auf eine baldige positive Antwort von Ihnen.\n",

Then, I worked for a company as a hardware board design engineer for two years. As it was a startup, I got hands-on experience working on PCB Board Design.
